\begin{abstract}
Philippine Normal University's Faculty of Arts and Languages seeks to improve its lengthy and tedious faculty loading process, and take the opportunity to employ faculty profiles to monitor faculty members, their information, and their activities. The proponents analyzed the business processes and areas of improvement of FAL, and set out to build a comprehensive information system that encapsulates these areas of improvement, with assistive faculty loading features and faculty profiles. These modules are the core of this innovation project that will serve as the pilot for specialized information systems in administrative functions for the Philippine Normal University.
