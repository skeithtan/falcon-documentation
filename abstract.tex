\begin{abstract}
Philippine Normal University's Faculty of Arts and Languages seeks to improve its teaching capability. To achieve this endeavor, FAL turns to research, and started a tracer study on its alumni. This project aims to deliver an information system that functions to assist FAL in performing the tracer study by delivering data processing and information visualization. The group has also identified other problems and opportunities to improve FAL's existing processes on faculty loading and faculty profile. These three modules are the core of this innovation project that will serve as the pilot project for specialized information systems in administrative functions for the Philippine Normal University.
